## Initial Non-Live Algorithm

The initial concept of the algorithm shows promising using dummy data collected from live ETH data. The graphical-pre.live branch shows the beginning steps of building the algorithm and refining the threshold values.

The algorithm is largly driven by the MA25 line which is the live data integrated to 25 points (25 seconds). When there is a peak or a trough and the difference between MA25 and the MA99 line then a point of interest is marked.
