## Command Line Non-Live Algorithm

Using the proposed trading conditions found in the [master](https://github.com/jamesstocktonj1/Crypto#algorithm-finalisation) readme, I created this branch to develop the command line implementation. The final product will be deployed on a non-graphical server so all the graphical plots will be generated in a seperate program (or potentially a website).


#### Disclaimer
This code is non-functional and for concept only. Do not use to trade as I will not be responsible for any money lost.
